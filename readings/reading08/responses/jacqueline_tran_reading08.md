	To summarize,generative and software art are not synonymous with each other but hold similarities. Generative art is focused on the outward presentation of art using efficient code, software is more focused on the systematic process of which the generative is arrived at. The software code may be experimental; some of it may be experimental and not meant to be used, purely decorate software. 
	According to the reading, software art can be the result of “autonomous and formal creative practice” but it can also “critically refer to existing software and technological, cultural, or social impact of software. One part I specifically enjoyed was that software art is something that occurs or happens in the computer and that the software written is the actual art itself. In today’s world, people seek to make the processes in software art visible. I have noticed that in modern art and it is something that seeks to make the intangible more tangible. The Internet today has become much more practical and integrated into our lives today because of software art. Software art allows us to recognize the Internet for what it is and demands playfully, for its presence to be known.
