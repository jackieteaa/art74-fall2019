Generative and software art are not anonymous with each other but hold similarities.
The following is a basic comparison of the two.
While generative art is focused on the outward presentation of art using efficient code, software is focused more on the systematic process of which the generative art is arrived at. The software or code may be experimental--some of the code may not be practical and inefficient.

It’s important to note that softwre art can be result of “autonomous and formal creative practice” but it “can also critically refer to existic software & the technological, cultural or social impact of software.” 

One part of the excerpt that I enjoyed was that software art is “art that happens in the computer”, and that the software is the actual art itself.

Today in the art world, people seek to make the processes in software art visible.
