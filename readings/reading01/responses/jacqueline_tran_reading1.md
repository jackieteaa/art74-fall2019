I thought the ideas of different colors combining to become wholly different colors was interesting. I'd already understood the concept of primary and secondary colors and have learned about the extent to which visible light appears to us. 
 
The part that stuck out most to me was that all colors mixed together become black and in the center of the wheel, everything is white.
There were a lot of errors in the essay but overall, an intersting read about the combination of colors. I wonder how it will apply in my future works and projects in the class using digital media. Also,
the 'Understanding the Light' link is a very complete and comprehensive guide to color. I am sure it will be very useful.
