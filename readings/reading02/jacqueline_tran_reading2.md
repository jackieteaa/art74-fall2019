I'm very interested in the potential of glitch art. I've seen instances of artwork with glitch art and I have had experiences in the past where I made art and the files glitched. I enjoy the idea that glitches aren’t particularly mistakes but are extensions of the artwork themselves and I believe in their potential to make for beautiful pieces of art. 
I’m looking forward to experimenting with glitch art and incorporating it into my portfolio and style. Surprisingly, it is more of a modern style and it piques my interest. Glitch art ultimately is a means for exploration and the possibilities are endless.
