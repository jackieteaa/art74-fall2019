  Witnessing the development of the Internet over the years has been a humbling process. The graphics have become much more improved since then. I remember fonts and layouts being more banal and pages to be much more unorganized. I like that the Internet started as an accident, as many impressive discoveries do. Also, the hacker-like community is inspiring to me. There are hackers that do many behind the scenes work to improve the Internet or fight for causes. Since the Internet is becoming more convoluted in the 21st century, I sometimes wonder what the world would be like with another Internet.
	In a few decades it might be interesting to fathom what the Internet would transform into. These days, the Internet can be strife with misinformation or an overload of information. There is an extreme mix of different age groups posting in anonymous forums and groups, which makes information hard to be organized and relied on. In summary, the Cyberfeminist Manifesto can also be intrusive and abrasive. The manifesto approaches environmental problems and human excess of materials in a mocking and sardonic way. The manifesto carries on way longer than it should and carries a level of deep cynicism and condescension.
  The video that accompanies the Cyberfeminist Manifesto should be refined so that the voice is not so hard to hear. In part, I was taken aback by all of the high-leveled words that the manifesto used. Clearly, they know more than the average person about what is going on with the internet and our resources; it is intended for a much more knowledgeable audience.
