Witnessing the Internetâ€™s humble beginnings as a slow development over the progression of decades through collective collaboration of artists and developers is an interesting process. I am surprised to read that the invent of the Internet began with an  accident, like many impressive discoveries do. I enjoy the hacker-like community of the early days of the Internet. Since the Internet has become much more convoluted in the 21st century, I sometimes wonder what the invent of a second Internet may be like.

In a few decades it might be interesting to fathom what the Internet will transform into. These days, the Internet is strife with anonymous posters from all sorts of different backgrounds and motives. Misinformation is abundant and it can be difficult to filter through everything. I wonder what kind of interventions users can implement using development and software in order to clean up the Internet.
