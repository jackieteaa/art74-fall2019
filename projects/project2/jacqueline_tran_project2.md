Name: Retro Playground
3D Model w/ Sketchfab & Meshmixer

Music: “Sea of Mars” from FMA 
The piece was conceived in Meshmixer with some of the stock models that the program already contained.
Some of the base models in the program were instrumental to the project. I am a beginner to the program so I decided to experiment with the already available stock options inside of the program. The geometric blocks in the background represent a playground suspended, representing a sort of ethereal experience.
The bunny is also suspended in an austere manner in space. The textures and coloration that I chose for the bunny and other models convey a retro feel and consecutively matches with the speckle-filled background. 
The audience might experience the piece in the same way I might; the bunny is casted into the spotlight with a galactic feel in the background. The feeling is hard to exemplify in words, but the audience might feel more comfortable in space.
My influence for the piece is my appreciation for the galactic world we live in. Having the stoic 3D models in space with the reflecting intonations bouncing light off each other conveys an abnormality that we otherwise might not fathom to experience. The models are experiencing a world of their own. Despite that, we are inspecting them in our own perspective. Ultimately, the piece may urge the audience to be more introspective about their experience in this seemingly 2D world we live in. 
The music was chosen to represent this concept. It is a little playful, but also with many space and galactic overtones.
