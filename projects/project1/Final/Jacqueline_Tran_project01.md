I take slightly on the idea of Greek gods and goddesses, attempting to convey both a feeling of novelty and an allusion to darkness. The concept of the idea made while browsing for images. The artwork is best understood from its title: Abyss. The simultaneous loss and pleasure of life resembles a deep chasm. Hopefully the audience can experience a pulling motion or radiation of energy from the center.
